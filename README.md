# Our system

In this repository you find various documentations and diagrams about our **infrastructure**, **processes** and **rewarding formulas**. We try to make everything we have and do as transparent as possible.

Also it's a good resource to see how we've built our infrastructure or make possible improvement suggestions if you have more experience than we do. Just [create an issue](https://github.com/bbwheroes/system/issues/new) for suggestions or questions.
